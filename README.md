# Fusion 360 Projects

A collection of CAD work created in **Fusion 360**, organized by project with drawings and renders for quick review.

## What’s inside
This repo focuses on:
- **Drawings (PDF)** — dimensioned documentation
- **Renders (PNG)** — presentation images / screenshots
- **Assemblies & parts** — separated for clarity

## Repository structure

Typical layout:
- `projects/`
  - `Parts/`
    - `drawings/` → part drawings (PDF)
    - `renders/`  → part renders (PNG)
  - `assemblies/`
    - `<assembly_name>/`
      - `drawings/` → assembly drawings (PDF)
      - `renders/`  → assembly renders (PNG)

Example from this repo:
- `projects/Parts/drawings/`
- `projects/Parts/renders/`
- `projects/assemblies/resume_assembly_1/drawings/`
- `projects/assemblies/resume_assembly_1/renders/`
